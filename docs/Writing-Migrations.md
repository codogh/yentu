Writing Migrations
==================
Migrations in yentu manipulate the database through the DatabaseItem class. There
are different sub classes of this DatabaseItem item class for different types of
database items (eg. tables, columns, primary keys etc.). To make it easy to write
migrations without worrying much about these classes, simpler wrapper functions and
classes are used.

Creating your first migration
-----------------------------
To create a migration execute the following from your command line.

    $ php vendor/bin/yentu create users
    
Yentu will create a skeleton migration file (`XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_migration.php`) in the 
`yentu/migrations` directory. The contents of this file will look close to this:

````php
/**
 * Generated by yentu on 9th February, 2016 07:11:57
 */

begin()

->end();
````

Creating Tables
---------------
To add a table to this migration you can modify this code to look as follows:

````php
<?php
/**
 * Generated by yentu on 30th May, 2016 17:41:44
 */

begin()
  ->table('users')
    ->column('id')->type('integer')->nulls(false)
    ->column('username')->type('string')->nulls(false)
    ->primaryKey('id')
    ->autoIncrement()
->end();
````

Finally, to execute this migration, you can execute the following command:

    $ php vendor/bin/yentu migrate
    
Adding with Columns
